##Book API
This is my first API using ExpressNodeJs built during my internship program at genesystechhub[www.genesystechhub.com]

##Details

#Brief
This is the basic structure of an API that allows you to perform the basic functions of a library. You can create a new library, create new books, add book, delete book, get book using the book's id, get book by searching for any of the parameter value.

#Hosting
You can run this on your local server using the port 3000 or you can change the port by modifying line 9 0f the bookAPI.js

#Testing
I tested this API using Google's Advanced Rest Client
